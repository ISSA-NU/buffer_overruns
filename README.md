# Buffer Overrun - An Introduction

Run, Buffer, Run!

This repository contains a list of vulnerable C programs. Each is a typical representative of vulnerabilities which can be reliably exploited by buffer-overrun based techniques.

Each subdirectory represents a specific attack style or defense mechanism. They are:

* Smash the Stack: [smash_stack](./smash_stack/README.md)

* Shellcode: [shellcode](./shellcode/README.md)

* Return-to-libc: [r2l](./r2l/README.md)

* Return Oriented Programming: [rop](./rop/README.md)

* Address Space Layout Randomization: [aslr](./aslr/README.md)

Start with [smash_stack](./smash_stack/README.md)!
